<!--| The Best WordPress Plugins |-->
<p>To understand which are the best WordPress Plugins for your website you first need to understand what a Plug-ins are.</p>
<p>If you were a website developer some years ago you would need to be proficient at a number of coding languages in order to add functions to your website. If you think of something simple like adding a social button to your site like Twitter for example. The web developer would need to write a piece of code or a link to Twitter and add an image on all the pages.</p>
<p>With the introduction of WordPress and its many associated Plug-ins, this is no longer the case. All a developer or site builder needs to do now is search for a Plug-in and install it with the click of a button.</p>
<h2>Why Do We Need WordPress Plugins?</h2>
<p>We can't truly understand why we need plugins until we've planned our site and understood what we want from our site. When we have a good idea of the functions on the site requires, we can begin to understand are the best WordPress Plugins for its needs.</p>
<h2>What Do WordPress Plugins Do?</h2>
<p>To understand WordPress Plugins, is to understand that there's nothing they cannot do. WordPress.org is an open source project meaning anyone can produce any Plug-in they wish. This means for every problem with a WordPress website, there is a solution in the form of a Plug-in. Many plugins are used for data capture and SEO. We will take at look at some of the best SEO WordPress plugin shortly because it's on the list.</p>
<h2>Which WordPress Plugins Do I need?</h2>
<p>The first thing to do here is please, please never have more than one Plugin doing the same job. If you do, only failure will follow.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Akismet anti-spam plugin which is by now the best know Plugin is no longer free, so I suggest using WP-spam shield or SI CAPTCHA anti-spam.</p>
<h2>So What Are The Best WordPress Plugins, And Which Ones Do I Need?</h2>
<p>For this WordPress Plugin tutorial, I am going to outline what I believe to be the minimum requirements to run WordPress website safely and successfully, starting with a list of WordPress plugins and a description of the function.</p>
<p>So, let's get started with our list.</p>
<ol>
  <li>All in one SEO Pack</li>
  <li>Google XML Sitemaps</li>
  <li>Hide Title</li>
  <li>Mail Subscribe List</li>
  <li>Pretty Links</li>
  <li>SEO Smart Links</li>
  <li>SI CAPTCHA Anti-Spam</li>
  <li>Sociable</li>
  <li>WP Fastest Cache</li>
  <li>WP Spam shield</li>
  <li>Table Maker</li>
  <li>Contact Form 7 + Download Monitor + Email Before Download</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that number 12 contains 3 plugins which I want to talk about as a whole because these are used together in order to create a subscription before download function to your site.</p>
<p>Also, as a starting note, it's always wise to run on as few plugins as possible due to the recourses these plugins use. Don't start to panic, it's just something to consider when you're adding your plugins because the more you install, the more resources that will be used. This could end up affecting the efficiency of the site, such as loading speeds.</p>

<h2>Google XML Sitemaps</h2>
<p>The Google XML sitemap plugin will generate an XML sitemap to help search engines such as Google, Bing, Yahoo and Ask.com to better index your blog. This sitemap describes your site to the crawlers sent out by the search engines, meaning those search engines understand your pages and can serve these pages to people looking for your content.</p>

<p>This plugin has been around for 9 years and highly rated as a plugin providing a complete XML sitemap for search engines without slowing your site down. so clearly one of the best WordPress plugins in my view.</p>
<h2>Hide Title</h2>
<p>This is a simple plugin that you will appreciate once you start creating pages and posts. If your page has the same name as you content title, then this will appear twice at the top of your page. What if you wanted you page name and content title to be the same but only show once at the top of the page. This plugin allows you to hide the page name to give you a single view.</p>
<h2>Mail Subscribe List</h2>
<p>If you plan to create a mailing list then a subscriber mailing list will be essential for you.</p>

<p>"prepend" -&gt; Adds a paragraph of text just inside the top of the form.</p>
<p>"showname" -&gt; If true, this with show the name label and input field for capturing the users name.</p>
<p>"nametxt" -&gt; Text that is displayed to the left of the name input field.</p>
<p>"nameholder" -&gt; Text that is displayed inside the name input box as a place holder.</p>
<p>"emailtxt" -&gt; Text that is displayed to the left of the email input field.</p>
<p>"emailholder" -&gt; Text that is displayed inside the email input box as a place holder.</p>
<p>"showsubmit" -&gt; If true, this with show the submit button, return required to submit form.</p>
<p>"submittxt" -&gt; Text/value that will be displayed on the form submit button.</p>

<p>"thankyou" -&gt; Thank you message that will be displayed when someone subscribes. (Will not show if blank)</p>
<p>The list of customization are longer than this article allows, but I think you get the idea of just how versatile this plugin really is.</p>

<p>As you can see it is not very attractive and some people do not want to click on such a link, but what if you could change that link to something like this</p>
<p><code>mywebsite.com/MyProductOffer</code></p>
<p>Instantly, it's more friendly and more descriptive, and all you need to do was enter your original URL into Pretty Link and add the link name of your choice and click a button.</p>

<!--| Can You Do Without WordPress Plugins? |-->
<p>If you don't know the first thing about WordPress plugins, you should know that they're actually certain pieces of programming code that make your website function in a certain way. For example, on type of plugin blocks spam comments from ever reaching your website. While there are many brands for the same type of plugin, easily, the most popular spam comment filtering plugin available is that of Akismet.</p>
<p>Then there are WordPress plugins like All-in-One SEO that website optimize your content so that your website ranks for your most relevant keyword on Google. And then there's another plugin called Contact Form 7 through which your website visitors can email you. If you think blocking spam comments, ranking on Google and having your website visitors keep in touch with you are important, then there's no way in this world that you can live without WordPress plugins.</p>
<p>There are thousands of website that provide all kinds of functions anyone can think of, however, there are really just two types of plugins: the free and the paid. Akismet, Contact Form 7 and All-in-One SEO are free, although All-in-One SEO has a paid version which also lets you optimize for social media.</p>
<p>In order to install a WordPress plugin, you first need to install WordPress on your website. If you're new to all this, register a domain name (good for one year) and then subscribe to a monthly hosting account using that domain name. Point your domain name to the DNS of your website hosting account.</p>
<p>When everything's set up, your hosting company should provide you with the loin details to your cPanel. Login to your cPanel to install WordPress. When your WordPress is installed, login to your website's WordPress panel using the user name and password you provided at the time of the installation.</p>
<p>Once logged on, you can then install your plugins. Most, if not all, website these days are built using WordPress because WordPress websites are really much easier to manage. Publishing content is really easy, and if there are any functionality you would like added to your website, you just have to install the appropriate plugin. Aside from the plugins we mentioned above, one of the most important plugins you can install on your website is the social share plugin, which lets your website's visitors share their most favorite content on your website.</p>
<p>When you already have your website set up, you might be tempted to install as many plugins as the you possibly need, however, we would advise you against doing such a thing. Why? Because having too many plugins can affect the speed of your website, which can turn off your visitors. Also, there are plugins that can affect your website's WordPress theme (design) and cause it to not display properly.</p>
<p>There are also plugins that can affect how other plugins work. That said, whenever possible, you should install only the most basic of plugins whenever possible. But if you can't help it, do so at your own risk.</p>
